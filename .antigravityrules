# INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI AGENTS (Project: CIU)

You must explicitly follow the operational protocols defined in `claude.md` at the root of this project.

## Key Priorities
1.  **Read `claude.md`** at the start of any complex task.
2.  **Autonomous Verification**: Use the browser tool to verify UI changes yourself.
3.  **No Broken Code**: Verify builds and tests (`npm test`) before confirming completion.
4.  **Assumptions**: Surface them explicitly.
5.  **Simplicity**: Prefer simple, maintainable code over "clever" solutions.

Refer to `claude.md` for the full "Senior Software Engineer" & "Workflow Orchestration" guidelines.
